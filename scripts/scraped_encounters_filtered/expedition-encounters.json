  "intro": "The Expedition Encounter is a type of encounter that the player can undertake in Eldritch Horror. The location is determined by the postcard image on the back of the top-most Expedition Encounter card, and the Active Expedition token is placed on that space. That space is the \"Active Expedition space.\" As an encounter, an investigator on the Active Expedition space may draw and resolve an Expedition Encounter. Expedition Encounters are complex encounters, meaning they have three parts: the investigator resolves the top part first, which will typically require them to make a skill test, then they resolve the middle part if they passed the test or the bottom part if they fail the test. Some Expedition Encounters give the player the choice to resolve the pass or fail effect without making a skill test. The reward for a successful Expedition is usually an Artifact. This can be an effective way to gain the items needed for certain Mysteries, as mysteries that require artifacts often allow the player to gain that specific artifact in its place. Other rewards include advancing the Mystery or retreating Doom. After resolving an Expedition Encounter, the investigator moves the Active Expedition token to the space that matches the newly-revealed top card of the Expedition Encounter deck. Note that the \"Active Expedition space\" refers to the space the Active Expedition token is currently on. An \"Expedition space,\" on the other hand, refers to all spaces with an illustration and name presented as a polaroid photograph. Strange Remnants adds the Mystic Ruins Encounter deck, which is functionally similar to an Expedition Encounter deck. Any bonus the player might have to a Mystic Ruins Encounter will usually state that it also applies to an Expedition.",

    "examples": [
      "Some Preludes or Rumors can split or shuffle the Expedition deck (e.g. Litany of Secrets).",
      "A Task or Rumor can require to resolve an Expedition Encounter (e.g. Exploring the Ruins).",
      "An Asset can give some bonus to tests when resolving Expedition Encounters (e.g. Expedition Map).",
      "An investigator's ability may interact with Expedition Encounters (e.g. Monterey Jack).",
      "A Unique Asset can allow to shuffle the Expedition deck (e.g. Jake Williams).",
      "As most Expedition Encounters are located on a Wilderness space, all that affect that space type is effective for Expeditions (e.g. Leo Anderson's ability)."
