  "intro": "A General Encounter is a sub-type of Location Encounter that may occur on any space provided it has not been Devastated. Just like a Research Encounter, each card is divided into three encounters based on the space the player is on: City, Wilderness, or Sea. Resolve the appropriate encounter when the card is read. Unlike a specific Location Encounter, there is no most common effect on a General Encounter. General Encounters generally have a bad risk/reward ratio, and are usually only chosen if the investigator cannot choose any other type of encounter. That said, some effects of General Encounters can be positive. If located on a City space, Darrell Simmons rolls 1 additional die when resolving a test during a General Encounter.",
