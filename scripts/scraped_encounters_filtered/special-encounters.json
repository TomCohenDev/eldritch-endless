  "intro": "A Special Encounter is a type of Card that can be used while playing Eldritch Horror. They are tailored to specific Ancient Ones and will only be used when the Mystery that specifies them is in play. Some Ancient Ones have a Final Mystery that is a Special Encounter. Other Ancient Ones don't have them at all. Special Encounters are a form of complex encounter, similar to Other World Encounters or Expedition Encounters, in which there is a short narrative ending with a skill test or choice to make, followed by branching paths that are taken whether or not the investigator passes or fails this test, which each usually have their own skill tests along with a benefit or penalty for passing or failing. Passing all skill tests on the card will usually result in making progress toward the active Mystery. If the Special Encounter is part of a Final Mystery, failing any skill test on the card can carry heavy penalties, up to and including devouring your investigator.",
