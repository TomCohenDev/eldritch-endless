When a Gate is spawned, a Monster is spawned on the same space. Gates are most commonly opened when spawned by a Mythos card when the appropriate symbol appears on the top part of the card, always occurring on the cards with yellow backgrounds. They may also be opened through certain Rumor Mythos cards, through a failed Encounter, or some condition effects.\n\nWhen there are no Gates remaining in the Gate stack, place all discarded Gates facedown in the Gate stack and randomize them. If a Gate cannot be spawn because the Gate stack and discard pile are empty, advance  by 1 instead.",
        "Closing Gates": "thumb|right|120px|Back of an Other World Encounter\nDuring the Encounter Phase, an investigator on a space containing a Gate may encounter it by drawing and resolving an Other World Encounter. Many Other World Encounters result in allowing the player to \"close\" the Gate. If this happens, the Gate token is removed from the board and put into a discard pile.\n\nSome effects, such as a Mystic Ruins Encounter, may allow an investigator to \"discard\" a gate from the game board. This follows the same process but is not considered \"closing\" the gate.",
        "Revealing Gates": "When an effect reveals a Gate, change one Gate token from the top of the Gate stack to a faceup position. Revealed Gates remain where they are in the Gate stack unless the effect that causes the Gates to be revealed states otherwise.\n\nIf an effect would cause a number of Gates to be revealed that exceeds the number of Gates in the Gate stack, the active investigator randomizes the Gates in the discard pile and places them at the bottom of the Gate stack before resolving that effect.\n\nAfter a Gate in the Gate stack has been revealed, it remains revealed until it is removed from the Gate stack or the Gate stack is randomized.\n\nRevealing a Gate that has previously been revealed has no additional effect. This won't stop other effects from manipulating those Gates; for instance, Randolph Carter will be able to put the top Gate on the bottom of the Gate stack if desired, even if the top Gate has already been revealed by some other effects.",
