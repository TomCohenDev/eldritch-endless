    "shortDescription": "Ever-weaving, ever watching, should Atlach-Nacha ever complete her empyrean masterpiece, it would merge the firmaments of the Dreamlands and reality into a single cosmic ingress, opening the way for the horrors of the Underworld to wage war upon the cities of humanity.",
    "lore": "Beware the moonlit shadows that cling to the corners of the cosmos, for within the cosmic tapestry, there exists a nightmarish weaver, an entity whose macabre dance threads the fabric of reality itself. This is the tale of Atlach-Nacha, the Spider God, whose dark presence weaves a web of horror that ensnares the minds of those who dare to uncover its eldritch secrets.\n\nIn the forgotten recesses of the Dreamlands, beyond the realms of mortal understanding, Atlach-Nacha waits in the stygian depths of its desolate domain. An arachnid deity of grotesque proportions, its form defies earthly logic, with countless spindly legs that writhe and skitter in unsettling harmony. In the cold, alien glow that illuminates its web, Atlach-Nacha spins a tapestry of nightmares, drawing upon the fears and phobias that lurk within the souls of mortals.\n\nLegends speak of a forsaken cavern, concealed in the heart of a desolate realm where reality itself seems to unravel. In that stygian abyss, Atlach-Nacha's monstrous lair echoes with the haunting clicks and whispers of a thousand unseen arachnid legs. The air is thick with a palpable malevolence, and the shadows dance with the anticipation of horrors that transcend mortal comprehension.\n\nIt is said that Atlach-Nacha, in its insatiable hunger for the forbidden threads of existence, beckons to those who seek forbidden knowledge. Those who, driven by insatiable curiosity or reckless ambition, dare to traverse the astral planes may find themselves ensnared in the eldritch web woven by the Spider God. Once trapped within its gossamer strands, the unfortunate souls become puppets to Atlach-Nacha's nightmarish whims.\n\nThe spider deity, with its ceaseless weaving, spins the fates of those entangled in its cosmic snare. Minds unravel like fragile silk, sanity slipping away with each agonizing moment spent within the clutches of the arachnid nightmare. The victims are left as hollow shells, forever ensnared in the inescapable threads of Atlach-Nacha's loathsome tapestry.\n\nWhispers of the Spider God's influence reach across dimensions, seeping into the dreams of those susceptible to its malevolent call. Its web, a reflection of the cosmic horrors that lurk beyond mortal comprehension, stretches across the boundaries of reality, leaving an indelible mark on the minds of those who dare to explore the forbidden corners of the Dreamlands.\n\nAnd so, in the eerie silence of the cosmic void, Atlach-Nacha continues its unholy dance, weaving a symphony of horror that resonates through the aether. Those who hear its nightmarish melody are forever marked, their souls entwined in the insidious threads of the Spider God's eternal tapestry",

    "lore": "In the heart of the cosmos, where the boundaries of reality blur into a chaotic abyss, there lies an entity of unimaginable horror—a blind, mindless deity that embodies the very essence of cosmic madness. This is the tale of Azathoth, the Nuclear Chaos, whose mindless existence threatens to unravel the fabric of the universe itself.\n\nAzathoth, the Daemon Sultan, resides at the center of the universe in a nightmarish realm known as the Court of Azathoth. An accursed throne amidst the swirling chaos, surrounded by an entourage of mindless, formless servitors that dance in a frenzied, eternal revelry. In the cosmic symphony of chaos, Azathoth is the conductor, orchestrating the discordant melodies that echo through the cosmos.\n\nLegend tells of the perilous journey through the void, where reckless sorcerers and astral travelers, driven by insatiable curiosity, sought the forbidden knowledge that lay hidden at the center of all existence. As they delved deeper into the cosmic tapestry, the air grew thick with the oppressive weight of impending dread.\n\nAt the threshold of the Court of Azathoth, where the boundaries between reality and insanity wavered, the seekers beheld a sight that defied reason—a maddening dance of formless entities, gyrating and swirling in an endless pandemonium. And at the center, enthroned in blasphemous majesty, Azathoth, the Daemon Sultan, slumbered in a state of perpetual oblivion.\n\nIt is said that the mind of Azathoth is an abyss, a void that consumes all reason and sanity. Its dreams are the chaotic nightmares that seep into the fabric of the universe, whispering madness to those unfortunate enough to listen. The very existence of Azathoth teeters on the brink of annihilation, a cataclysmic force that, if awakened, would spell doom for reality itself.\n\nIn the darkest corners of forbidden tomes, the name Azathoth is spoken only in hushed, terrified whispers. Those who seek to invoke its name or unravel the mysteries of its accursed realm risk a descent into the abyss of lunacy. The very thought of Azathoth, the Nuclear Chaos, is enough to send shivers down the spines of even the most seasoned scholars of the arcane.\n\nAnd so, the legend of Azathoth persists—a harrowing tale of cosmic horror that warns of the dangers that lie at the heart of the universe. To tread too close to the Nuclear Chaos is to court madness, for in the maddening dance of Azathoth's court, the boundaries between nightmare and reality dissolve, leaving only the void of eternal, mindless chaos.",

    "lore": "In the shadowed annals of ancient Egypt, where the sands whispered secrets and the pyramids cradled forgotten mysteries, there arose a pharaoh whose name echoed through the corridors of time like a chilling wind. His name was Nephren-Ka, a ruler whose thirst for power reached beyond the realm of mortal understanding.\n\nNephren-Ka, adorned in regal splendor, walked a treacherous path bathed in the dim glow of forbidden knowledge. Beneath the veils of opulence and majesty, he harbored a sinister desire—an insatiable hunger for immortality that led him down a darkened corridor, away from the light of the sun and into the heart of unspeakable darkness.\n\nHidden deep within the labyrinthine chambers of his pyramid, Nephren-Ka delved into the forbidden arts, calling upon eldritch forces that slumbered in the abyss between worlds. The air within his unholy sanctum became thick with the stench of ancient malevolence, as he uttered incantations that no living soul was meant to comprehend.\n\nWith each sacrilegious ritual, Nephren-Ka's connection to the mortal coil waned, and an otherworldly pallor overcame his countenance. His eyes, once radiant with life, now mirrored the void of eternity. The whispers of the damned echoed in his ears, guiding him through the macabre dance of forgotten incantations that promised everlasting existence.\n\nAs the years unfurled like a tattered scroll, tales of Nephren-Ka's unholy pursuits spread fear among the people. Legends spoke of ghastly visions haunting the dreams of those who dared to gaze upon the ruins of his accursed pyramid. Unspeakable horrors were said to stir in the depths beneath the shifting sands, and the very air seemed to carry the weight of an ancient malevolence.\n\nBut even the mighty are not immune to the relentless march of time. Nephren-Ka's once-grand empire crumbled into the dust, swallowed by the same desolation that birthed his insatiable ambition. The remnants of his dark legacy lingered like a lingering curse, waiting to ensnare those who dared tread upon the ruins of his once-majestic kingdom.\n\nAnd so, the legend of Nephren-Ka endures—a cautionary tale whispered in the dark corners of forgotten temples and within the haunted winds that sweep across the barren expanse of the Egyptian sands. The pharaoh who sought to defy the natural order, to transcend mortality, now stands as a spectral reminder of the abyss that awaits those who dare to grasp at the forbidden threads of eternity.",

    "lore": "In the shadowed pages of forbidden tomes, there lies an ominous narrative, a tale that speaks of Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos—a malevolent entity whose dark presence traverses the realms of mortal understanding. Born from the obsidian depths of the Outer Gods, Nyarlathotep manifests as an enigmatic and shape-shifting deity, a force that weaves its malevolence through the fabric of reality.\n\nKnown by the moniker of the Dark Pharaoh, Nyarlathotep is an anomaly among the cosmic horrors, delighting in the orchestration of madness and chaos upon the mortal realm. Unlike its incomprehensible kin, Nyarlathotep assumes myriad forms, often adopting guises that range from beguiling charisma to grotesque horror, leaving mortals in perpetual disarray.\n\nLegends and lore recount the entity's descent upon Earth, clad in masks of allure or nightmare, as it traverses cities and villages in an insidious procession. The indelible mark of Nyarlathotep taints reality itself, spreading like a virulent contagion, and those who encounter its elusive presence find their sanity unraveled, their minds ensnared by the malevolent will of the Crawling Chaos.\n\nThe whispers of Nyarlathotep resonate through the corridors of time, captivating seekers of forbidden knowledge who dare to tread the precarious line between curiosity and insanity. Its dark influence infiltrates the dreams of the susceptible, constructing a tapestry of nightmares that entwines the minds of those drawn into the eldritch realms. Once ensnared by its insidious charm, individuals become pawns in a cosmic game, forever bound to the unpredictable will of the enigmatic deity.\n\nlathotep's motives remain shrouded in mystery, and its machinations unfold with an unpredictable rhythm. Encounter with this cosmic malevolence is a confrontation with the embodiment of chaos, a force that waltzes on the precipice between nightmare and reality.\n\nThus, if ever the distant whispers or chilling touches of the unseen assail your senses, heed caution, for Nyarlathotep may be at work, unfurling its dark tapestry within the concealed recesses of shadows, ready to ensnare the unsuspecting in its web of eldritch horror.",

    "lore": "In the tomes of eldritch knowledge, within pages aged by the weight of centuries, there exists a dread account of Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. This blasphemous entity is a force of primal fertility and unspeakable horror.\n\nDescribed in ancient manuscripts as the All-Mother, Shub-Niggurath is an entity beyond mortal comprehension, an eldritch force that embodies the chaotic essence of creation and destruction. Her name, whispered in hallowed tones among those who dare delve into forbidden lore, evokes a sense of dread and reverence.\n\nShrouded in the misty veils of distant realms, legends speak of Shub-Niggurath as a dark deity with a form that defies earthly description. Some accounts portray her as a monstrous, amorphous mass, with appendages and protuberances that writhe and undulate in an obscene dance. Others tell of a grotesque fertility deity adorned with a profusion of twisted, horned forms.\n\nThe Black Goat of the Woods is said to dwell in shadowed groves and hidden corners of the cosmos, where the veil between dimensions is thin. Her presence is accompanied by an eerie cacophony—a symphony of disconcerting noises that echo through the eldritch realms, a manifestation of the thousand young that spring forth from her formless womb.\n\nWorshipers of Shub-Niggurath, often deranged and devoted to the forbidden rites, partake in rituals that invoke the dark blessings of the All-Mother. These ceremonies, conducted in secluded places where the boundaries of reality are fragile, are said to unleash unspeakable forces and call forth nightmarish offspring that join the Black Goat's grotesque progeny.\n\nThe lore surrounding Shub-Niggurath is fraught with madness and terror, a testament to the ancient cosmic horror that lurks beyond the veil of human understanding. Her name, whispered in hallowed tones or inscribed in forgotten manuscripts, remains a chilling reminder of the forbidden knowledge that lies hidden in the annals of the eldritch world",

Killing a snake makes Yig wrathful, and he usually punishes said killer by either death or transforming them into a new snake.\n\nYig was notably angered in 1889 by a traveling married couple. The wife discovered a nest of newborn rattlesnakes, and since her husband had ophidiophobia, decided to kill them by smashing them to death. Yig himself would start to torment the couple later that same year. He ordered his children to kill the couple's dog and haunt the wife. He managed to trick the wife to kill her own husband, making her think it was the Great Old One. After this he would transform her into a part-human, part-reptile monstrosity, that was forced to wriggle on her belly like a snake. She is taken to an asylum, and dies there ... but not before giving birth to four half-snake creatures.\n\nYig's appearance is often either as a gigantic serpent with the arms of a man or as a reptilian humanoid creature. He is also said to be the myth behind certain serpent-like deities such as legends of the K’uk’ulkan and Quetzalcoatl from Mesoamerican culture and literature.",

    "shortDescription": "For eons, sorcerers have called upon the power of Yog-Sothoth to bend reality to their will. This incomprehensible Ancient One exists parallel to all places and times, but is bound to the space between dimensions. Gates between worlds continue to open with more frequency and soon, Yog-Sothoth will be free.",
    "lore": "Within the musty tomes of arcane knowledge, penned by hands long turned to dust, there lies a tale veiled in cosmic dread—the lore of Yog-Sothoth, the All-in-One, the Lurker at the Threshold. In the eldritch annals of the Cthulhu Mythos, this ineffable entity stands as a guardian of cosmic secrets, a being whose presence transcends the very fabric of space and time.\n\nDescribed in ancient manuscripts as a confluence of boundless spheres and iridescent tendrils, Yog-Sothoth is an entity of infinite knowledge and awareness. Its form, if form it can be called, is a grotesque amalgamation of angles and dimensions beyond mortal comprehension. It exists simultaneously at every point in the universe, a sentient nexus that witnesses the unfolding of past, present, and future with a detached omniscience.\n\nLegends speak of Yog-Sothoth as a custodian of forbidden knowledge, a guardian of cosmic gateways that connect disparate realms. The astral currents that flow through the veiled dimensions are said to be under the watchful gaze of this cosmic sentience. The Lurker at the Threshold is both a key and a gate, holding the secrets to realities beyond mortal reckoning.\n\nWhispers in the esoteric corridors of forgotten libraries tell of those who sought communion with Yog-Sothoth. Foolhardy scholars and seekers delving into the occult would perform intricate rituals, drawing upon ancient symbols and incantations to breach the veil between dimensions. In these moments of forbidden communion, Yog-Sothoth would manifest, its presence heralded by an uncanny radiance that defied the natural order.\n\nTo those who glimpsed the cosmic horror of Yog-Sothoth, the revelation was both enlightenment and madness. The knowledge bestowed by the All-in-One often proved too vast for mortal minds to bear, shattering sanity like fragile glass. Those who dared invite Yog-Sothoth's presence became forever bound to the eldritch currents, their fates interwoven with the cosmic tapestry the entity guarded.\n\nYog-Sothoth's name is uttered with reverence and fear, a testament to its cosmic significance. In the dim glow of candlelit chambers, occult scholars murmur incantations to invoke the Lurker at the Threshold, seeking forbidden knowledge that dances on the periphery of mortal understanding.\n\nThus, within the weathered pages of ancient manuscripts, the lore of Yog-Sothoth persists—a tale of a cosmic entity that transcends the limitations of time and space, beckoning those who dare to seek the forbidden wisdom that lies at the nexus of existence itself.",
