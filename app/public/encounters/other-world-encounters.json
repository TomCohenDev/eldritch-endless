  "intro": "An investigator on a space containing a Gate may choose to complete an Other World Encounter; Other World Encounters are the primary way in which investigators close Gates. Other World Encounters are complex encounters; the pass effect usually allows players to close the Gate that they are on. The fail effect may allow the investigator to still close the Gate if they pass a test, but more often than not the fail effect will only allow them to pass through unharmed if they succeed.",

      "An investigator ability can add a dice when resolving a test during Other World Encounters (e.g. Gloria Goldberg).",
